This folder contains the userguide for the Legacy RSEC program. 
All the files needed to run the program are in the 'Legacy' and 'Legacy2' folders. 

The Legacy software will run on earlier versions of MATLAB(2014-2016) that don't have the app-designer. It will also run stand alone on later versions (2016-2018).


Download and combine in one folder to run.
